# üï∏Ô∏è eAuth: A Robust Auth System üï∏Ô∏è

This is a `Role Based Access Control (RBAC)` application using Node.js, Express.js, and Passport.js, etc.

You can use this application as the starting point for whatever project you are going to build which needs authentication system.

For authentication we have only `Email` & `Password` option but other authentication options using `OAuth` like Google, Apple, and GitHub, etc. can be easily incorporated.

The application is based on the **`MVC pattern`** i.e. `Model` | `View` | `Controller`.

**`Mongoose`** is used as an `ORM` for `MongoDB` for storing Users in Database.

**`Passport.js`** is used for local(email, password) authentication.

The application is **`production ready`**.

I have added complete process walkthrough screenshots in `output` directory.

`# Admin Login #`
```
Email: admin@gmail.com - Mandatory
Password: Set according to you
```
